## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-10

### [Download](https://github.com/glutanimate/highlight-search-results/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

### Added

- Added support for Anki **2.1.41** and up
- Added support for configuring the add-on through Anki's built-in **add-on config window**
- All **hotkeys** are now fully **configurable**

### Fixed

- Fixed selecting next card on Anki 2.1.24 and up (thanks to @ijgnord for the report, #1)

### Changed

- **Rewrote most of the add-on**, focusing on bringing the add-on up to speed with all the latest and greatest in Anki development. This should make the add-on more robust against upcoming changes in Anki.

    Still, Anki has been undergoing a lot of changes under the hood recently, and these tend to break add-ons. So for the best add-on experience, my advice would be to stick to Anki version you are using until Anki prompts you to update.
- Dropped support for Anki 2.0
- Migrated to new repository and build system
